# 🧠 Income Prediction using Adult Census Data

This project is a step-by-step machine learning pipeline to predict whether a person's income exceeds $50K/year based on census data.

## 📂 Files Included
- `train.csv` / `test.csv`: Data used for training and testing
- `income_prediction.py`: Complete code walkthrough
- `visualizations.png`: Exploratory Data Analysis charts
- `models/`: Folder containing trained models (if any)

## 📌 Project Steps
1. Data Loading & Understanding
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Data Preprocessing
4. Feature Engineering
5. Model Building (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
6. Model Evaluation
7. Insights & Visualizations

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Dataset Source
UCI Machine Learning Repository - [Adult Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult)

## 📊 Sample Visuals
- Age distribution by income
- Education level vs income
