#  Income Prediction using Adult Census Data

This project is a step-by-step machine learning pipeline to predict whether a person's income exceeds $50K/year based on census data.

##  Files Included
- `train.csv` / `test.csv`: Data used for training and testing
- `income_prediction.ipynb`: Complete code walkthrough
-
